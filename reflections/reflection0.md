#Reflection 0 - Serena Chen

The beginning of this course definitely got off to a rough start. I missed the first class, and as a result, was very stunted in finding a team and kicking off sprint planning. Luckily, everything worked out, as the team I ended up with had similar interests in learning about how low level computing is implemented, and we decided on a project that would interest all of us, based on our conversations about our personal learning goals and interests.

Since we formed our team so late, we began scrum today, during our late-night meeting when we finished sprint planning. During sprint planning, we focused mostly on providing ourselves a background in C and in the project we hoped to work on (a server that will respond to http requests). However, we did not plan specific tasks for the project, since we were not sure how to approach it, and we felt we didn't know enough to begin planning it. We wanted to spend this first sprint learning and getting used to the language and concepts.

In terms of choosing a scrum master, we essentially nominated Annie, and she agreed to do it. We have not yet really split responsibilities, since many of our activities this sprint were things we would all do in parallel, like readings and exercises. Our backlog is basically the list of chapters and exercises to go through that we believe will help us with our first project.

I'm still not sure if we have scoped our sprint appropriately, or if I can pace myself in order to keep up with the course and the projects. However, I believe that over time, I will adjust my goals and learning pace accordingly.
